I am currently a PhD  candidate (2015 -- Present) at [Rythm]("https://dreem.com/") and in [Image, Data Signal Department]("http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/en/") at [Télécom ParisTech]("http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/en/"). I am supervised by [Alexandre Gramfort]("http://alexandre.gramfort.net/") and co-advised by [Mathieu Galtier]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgaltier/?ppe=1) and [Gilles Wainrib]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilles-wainrib-028a622/")



My work mainly focuses on processing EEG signals with deep learning algorithms and covers different aspects of machine learning such as transfer learning in general and domain adaptation.



I graduated from [TUM]("https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/") (2014-2016) and from [École Polytechnique]("https://www.polytechnique.edu/en") (2011-2014) were I developped a strong interest in mathematics and machine learning in particular.
