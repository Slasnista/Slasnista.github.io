I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning (2015 -- Present) working in collaboration with [Dreem](https://dreem.com/en/) and in [Image, Data Signal Department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/en/) at [Télécom ParisTech](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/en/). I am supervised by [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/) and co-advised by [Mathieu Galtier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgaltier/?ppe=1) and [Gilles Wainrib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilles-wainrib-028a622/).

I am currently working at the [Stanford University Sleep Center](http://med.stanford.edu/sleepdivision.html) as a Visiting Student Research under [Emmanuel Mignot](http://med.stanford.edu/narcolepsy/mignot.html)'s supervision.

My work mainly focuses on processing EEG signals with deep learning algorithms and covers different aspects of machine learning such as transfer learning in general and domain adaptation as long as different tasks such as classification and event/object detection.


I graduated from [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) (2014-2016) and from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (2011-2014) were I developped a strong interest in mathematics and machine learning in particular.
