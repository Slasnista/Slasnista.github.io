I am currently a datascientist at [Therapixel](http://www.therapixel.com/) working on the project [mammoscreen](http://www.mammoscreen.com/) to develop machine learning algorithms to improve breast cancer screening.

I completed a PhD in Machine Learning (2015 -- 2018) at [Dreem](https://dreem.com/en/) and [Image, Data Signal Department](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/en/) at [Télécom ParisTech](http://www.tsi.telecom-paristech.fr/en/). I worked under the supervision of [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/) and I was also co-advised by [Mathieu Galtier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgaltier/?ppe=1) and [Gilles Wainrib](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilles-wainrib-028a622/). In summer 2018, I also worked as Visiting Student Researcher at the [Stanford University Sleep Center](http://med.stanford.edu/sleepdivision.html) under the supervision of [Emmanuel Mignot](http://med.stanford.edu/narcolepsy/mignot.html).

My work focused on the development of machine learning algorithms to process electro-encephalography time series during sleep. The main tasks were the classification of sleep stages and the detection and classification of "micro-events" such as sleep spindles or K-complexes.

I graduated from [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/homepage/) (2014-2016) and from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (2011-2014) were I developped a strong interest in mathematics, physics and machine learning in particular.
